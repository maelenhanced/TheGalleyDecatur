            <h1>The Galley<br />Featuring our Famous Fish</h1>
            <p>The Galley is a family-owned restuarant established in 1978 in Decatur, Indiana. What better way
                to celebrate 40 years in business than a new look and new menus. Along with new items on the menu,
                we still offer the same classic cod filet that has made us famous. With well over 3 million pounds of
                our delicious cod served to date. While we are known for our cod, we still offer a wide variety of other
                seafood, as well as chicken, steaks, sandwiches, and a outstanding salad bar by the boat load. In addition to
                the main dining area, we can offer a banquet room for larger groups as well as a full service bar room known
                as "The Starboard Side". We offer an entirely smoke free environment.
            </p>
            <p>We continue to stress the things that keep our customers coming back time and time again, like serving quality food
                at reasonable prices, having a wonderful, friendly crew, and a fresh, clean, nautical atmosphere in which to dine. We
                are very proud of our commitment to our customers, employees, and community!
